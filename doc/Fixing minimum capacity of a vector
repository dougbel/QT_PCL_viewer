Using

	std::vector<int> aux_ids;
        aux_ids.reserve( 255 );

this helps user specify the number minimum of capacity of a vector, this help to allocate enough memory instead of beeing incrementing it and reallocating data during execution. More info in https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/using-stdvectorreserve-whenever-possible/


or since the definition

	std::vector<float> mags_c(sampleSize);
